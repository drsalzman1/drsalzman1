            <div style=margin-top:0.5em></div>
            A player creates a game by naming themself, the player to their left, the player across, and the player to their right.
            If the creator is online, the creator can choose whether each player is a remote player or a local robot.
            The creator can also choose the types of assistance provided.<br>
            <br>
            Once the creator names the players and makes their choices, they click their Create button and wait for others to join.<br>
            <br>
            Remote players join by naming themselves, clicking their Join buttons, and waiting for others to join.<br>
            <br>
            After everyone joins, the creator will shuffle and deal the cards, and the game will begin.

            <b>Double Deck Pinochle - Rules</b><br>
            <div style=margin-top:0.5em></div>
            The dealer deals a deck of 80 cards: 4 cards of each rank (ordered ace, ten, king, queen, jack) in each suit (spades, 
            hearts, clubs, diamonds).<br>
            <br>
            The player to the left of dealer must bid at least 50 or pass.
            The next player to the left must bid higher (5 higher starting at 60) or pass. 
            Bidding continues until only one bidder remains.
            If the first three players pass, the fourth player (dealer) must bid.
            The final bidder picks a trump suit (which outranks the other suits) and plays first.<br>
            <br>
            The first player may lead any card.
            The next player to the left must follow the lead suit if possible, and if the lead's not been trumped, 
            must beat the high card in the lead suit if possible.
            If they can't follow the lead, they must play trump if possible, and beat any high trump if possible.
            If they can't follow the lead or play trump, they can play any card.
            Play continues until everyone has played a card.<br>
            <br>
            The winner then collects the trick and leads the next trick if possible.
            When the hand is over, the player to the left of dealer deals the next hand until the game is over.<br>

            The bidder's meld for each possible trump suit is displayed while they're bidding.<br>
            <br>
            A team's meld is the sum of their meld.
            If the sum is less than 20, it won't count towards their score.<br>
            <br>

            <b>Double Deck Pinochle - Scoring</b><br>
            <div style=margin-top:0.5em></div>
            After bidding, each player reveals their meld.
            Even if a player's team melds less than 20, the player must reveal if they have aces around.
            If a player wins the bid without a run or marriage in trump, they can't play (must toss) the hand.
            The bid winner may also choose to toss a hand.<br>
            <br>
            After each hand, each team counts their take.
            Each ace, ten and king is worth 1.
            Taking the last trick is worth 2.
            If a team's take is less than 20, their take is 0.<br>                 
            <br>
            Normally, each team's score increases by their meld plus take.
            However, if the bid-winning team's meld plus take is less than their bid, their score decreases by their bid.
            The first team to reach 500, wins.
            If both teams reach 500, the bid-winning team wins.<br>

            <b>Double Deck Pinochle - Communicating</b><br>
            <div style=margin-top:0.5em></div>
            Players are not allowed to directly communicate their cards or strategy to their partner.
            This is called talking across the table.
            However, they can reveal certain information by the way they bid and play.<br>
            <br>
            Robots use jump bids.
            If a player starts the bid at 52 or increases the bid by 2, the robot assumes they have a marriage and 20 meld.
            If a player starts the bid at 53 or increases the bid by 3, the robot assumes they have a marriage and 30 meld, etc.
            Robots assume players have 14 meld unless their partner provides a jump bid.<br>
            <br>
            Robots ignore indicators.
            If a player plays an ace or jack on their partner's ace, robots assume nothing.<br>
            <br>
            The game creator can choose an open hands game that reveals everyone's cards.
            This allows players to <del>cheat</del> learn, but robots don't exploit open hands.<br>

            <div style=margin-top:0.5em></div>
            Players know their own cards and reveal their cards when they lay down their meld, play a card,
            trump the lead suit, don't beat a high card, or don't follow the lead suit.<br>
            <br>
            The game creator can choose to show the card count summary for each player where the opacity of each suit icon 
            indicates the player's cards:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>100% - definitely has an ace in that suit</li>
                <li>66% - may have an ace in that suit</li>
                <li>33% - doesn't have an ace in that suit</li>
                <li>0% - has no cards in that suit</li>
            </ul><br>
            The game creator can also choose to show the card count detail for each player.
            The table shows the minimum and maximum number of cards each player
            has revealed for each rank of each suit using rectangles:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Black quadrants indicate the minimum number of cards in that player/rank/suit</li>
                <li>Black/gray quadrants indicate the max number of cards in that player/rank/suit</li>
                <li>Four white quadrants indicate there are no cards in that player/suit/rank</li>

            The game creator can also choose to display a count of how many trump cards remain in other players' hands. <br>
            <br>

            <div style=margin-top:0.5em></div>
            The robots bid up to a limit based on their meld, their estimate of their partner's meld (perhaps based on a jump bid),
            and their estimate of the strength of their playing hand.<br>
            <br>
            The robots count the cards that each player reveals as meld.
            For example, if you reveal a king of clubs but no queen of clubs, the robot knows you don't have a queen of clubs.
            The robot also counts the cards that each player reveals during play.
            For example, if you play a jack of clubs on a king of clubs, it knows you don't have a ten or ace of clubs.
            This app offers a menu option to display such stats from your perspective without cheating.<br>
            <br>
            If a robot estimates that its team can win the trick, it plays the card that it estimates will
            take the trick, 
            take the most points, 
            spend the fewest of its team's high and trump cards, and
            waste the most of its opponents' high and trump cards.
            If the robot estimates that its team will lose the trick, it plays the card that it estimates will
            lose the fewest points, 
            waste the fewest of its team's high and trump cards, and
            waste the most of its opponents' high and trump cards.<br>
